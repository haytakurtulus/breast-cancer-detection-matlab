# Breast Cancer Detection with Decision Trees (MATLAB) 🧬

In this project, I explored Supervised Learning algorithms by building a Decision Tree classifier to distinguish between Malignant and Benign tumors. The goal was to implement the Gini Impurity index logic using MATLAB's statistical toolbox.

⚙️ Key Implementations:
Dynamic File Handling: Instead of hardcoding filenames, I wrote a script that automatically detects and loads .csv or .data files in the directory.

Data Preprocessing: The code automatically cleans unnecessary columns (like IDs) and prepares the Feature/Target matrices.

Optimized Model: Used fitctree with Pruning enabled to prevent overfitting and visualize the decision nodes clearly.

Visual Analytics: Generates a full Decision Tree graph and a Confusion Matrix to evaluate True/False Positives.

📊 Model Performance
Since the script uses a randomized 70/30 Train-Test split to simulate real-world variance:

Typical Accuracy: 92% - 96% (Varies slightly per run).

Here are the outputs generated by the MATLAB script:
